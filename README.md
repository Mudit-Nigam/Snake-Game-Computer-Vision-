# Computer-Vision-Final-Project

This project reimagines the Snake Game by integrating computer vision. Players control the snake, collecting food and avoiding obstacles. What sets it apart is the ability to control the snake using real-world objects detected through a camera feed. Computer vision algorithms analyze the feed in real-time, translating object positions into commands for the snake's movement. This immersive gameplay experience blends reality with virtuality, offering dynamic interaction. Whether navigating household items or custom obstacles, players enjoy a fusion of nostalgia and innovation.
